In GPU-based parallel programming, we transfer data from the CPU to the GPU, where the actual computation takes place, by using CUDA C/C++. This allows us to harness the immense computational power of GPU cores for faster processing.

## At this stage, you might be wondering about two key points:

- What exactly is CUDA?
- How do we transfer data between the CPU and GPU, and how can we fully utilize the GPU’s parallel processing capabilities?

**In this chapter, we’ll cover these fundamental concepts and walk through a simple "Hello World" program in CUDA C to help you get started with GPU programming.**
